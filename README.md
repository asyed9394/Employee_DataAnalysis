## Analysis Results

### Retiring employees title count:

1. The file [Retirement Titles](Data/retirement_titles.csv) shows all the titles held by employess who are reaching retirement baased on birth dates between Jan 1 1952 to Dec 31st 1955. Some of the employess have been long enough with company that they thave multiple changes in the job title during their tenure.e.g employee # 10004 was an engineer from Dec1 1986 to dec 1 1995 and then promoted to senior engineer thereafter .
        
         emp_no	first_name	last_name	title	from_date	to_date    
        10001	Georgi	Facello	Senior Engineer	6/26/1986	1/1/9999    
        10004	Chirstian	Koblick	Engineer	12/1/1986	12/1/1995    
        10004	Chirstian	Koblick	Senior Engineer	12/1/1995	1/1/9999      
    
    So we did the analysis using the latest titles for the retiring employees. The retiring employess with most recent titles are available in [Retiring Employess with latest title](Data/unique_titles.csv)
    
2.There are only 2 employess with title "Manager" and more than 60% of the employess have "senior" level titles. Only 29% of employess seems to have a junior level title.
