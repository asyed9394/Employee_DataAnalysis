Some of the employess have been long enough with companyt that they thave multiple changes in the job title during their tenur.e.g employee # 10004 was an engineer from Dec1 1986 to dec 1 1995 and then promoted to senior engineer thereafter .
        
         emp_no	first_name	last_name	title	from_date	to_date    
        10001	Georgi	Facello	Senior Engineer	6/26/1986	1/1/9999    
        10004	Chirstian	Koblick	Engineer	12/1/1986	12/1/1995    
        10004	Chirstian	Koblick	Senior Engineer	12/1/1995	1/1/9999
